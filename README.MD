# Background (Description of project)
The game I will be creating is called "Guess the Word", which is basically
an implementation of the common game "Hangman. A simple description of the 
gameplay is that the user will be presented a random word where the word is
comprised of blank letters, however they're given the amount of letters or 
spaces for that word. The user then will be given lives and they will select
a single letter as a guess. They'll either lose a life if they get the letter
incorrectly, or will be given where that letter occurs in the word. So the 
user has to guess all the characters in the word before they lose all
their lives to win. There will also be diffeent difficulties and modes
if they want more of a challenge.



# Functionality & MVPSs
* Be allowed to choose a letter at a time to try to guess the random word
based on how many lives they're given.
* Be allowed to choose which difficulty they want, or game style
* Lives will depend on difficulty.
* Displaying/hiding the letters chosen will depend on game style.
*  Will have one free hint availiable per word if the user requests it.
*  Able to give up one life to gain a last second hint

# In addition, this project will include: 
*  Instructions how to play the game
*  Display the lives nicely on the screen

# BONUS
*  Background music, sound effects, animation
*  A local scoreboard to keep track of how little guesses that a user took.

# Technologies, libraries, API's
Nothing extra needed, but potentially an API for random words.
